### Functionality

This is the [Chess](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/ruby-final-project) project, which creates a 2-player chess game with Ruby.

### Thoughts

This was definitely a challenge! I spent a lot of time on this one, on everything from planning out the structure of the program in the first place, to constant tweaks to correct the errors that I frequently ran into. It feels great to be done and to have a working chess game now.

I know that my code isn't 100% perfect, and that there's a fair bit more refactoring that I can do. At this point, I'm eager to move on to the next lessons, so because the game at least works, I'm leaving it as it is. In the future, I hope to come back with a clear mind and some more experience, and try improving on the efficiency and quality of my code.

Also, in the future, I'd like to implement very simple AI functionality, that simply picks a random move from the available ones. Shouldn't be too difficult, but I'll leave that for my eventual return to this project.

God bless.
